\section{General summary}
%
The Arctic is a water world, experiencing rapid warming. Passive microwave 
satellite observations are in general required to study water in the region and
the basic aim of the project is to improve the utilisation of this data source,
particularly the high-frequency part. The project targets water in the
atmosphere. The primary concern is the estimation of humidity, but the retrieval
system is highly versatile and retrievals of liquid water content, snowfall and
sea-ice concentration (in order of priority) are also feasible.

We propose a physically-based, Bayesian-oriented, machine-learning model for
the task. The model is trained by detailed 3D radiative transfer simulations,
to generate local scenes of measured radiances. The input to the simulations
has a horisontal resolution finer than the size of the satellite footprints.
For example, high-resolution SAR imagery is applied to describe the
distrubution of sea-ice\,/\,open water at a resolution of ?\,km. As a result,
aspects like inhomogeneous filling and overlap of the footprints are
incorporated into the simulations and are then automatically included in the
retrieval process, in contrast to existing data extraction. Precipitation and
clouds are modelled in detail by combining a mesoscale model with an in-house
expertise on microwave radiative transfer involving hydrometeors. As we cover
all significant parts of the ``forward problem'', our inversions can be truly
``all-sky''; we aim for a zero data rejection (for the set of channels
considered).

The resulting dataset(s) would play an important role in not only analysing the
variability of water above the Arctic, but also in deciphering the
ongoing trends involved in the Arctic amplification of global warming.



%Water vapour plays an important role in the water and energy cycle over the polar regions, especially over Arctic. Over the Arctic, changes in the water vapour content are most sought to observe the warming trends, also know and Artic amplification. However over poles, the ground measurements are sparse and the performance of the satellite retrievals is constrained by the highly variable surface emissivity. The basic aim of this project is to develop new retrieval algorithms principally for total water vapour (TWV) from satellite microwave radiometer data over the Arctic. We propose a physically based retrievals, using a Bayesian machine learning based inversion method. Additionally, this algorithm could be used to also retrieve side products like total liquid water content (LWC) and sea-ice concentration (SIC). A key feature of this algorithm would be the use high resolution SAR imagery to classify sea-ice and open waters. Fine scale sea-ice information is necessary for distinguishing emissivity between different surface types. Another crucial aspect of the development line will be to use data from multiple microwave frequencies, with different footprint size, and avoiding the remapping of data. The overall scheme shall be similar to the one in a parallel SNSA 2021 proposal submitted by co-applicant Patrick Eriksson.
%The resulting dataset would play an important role in not only analysing the water vapour variability of the Arctic atmospheric but also in deciphering the trends the Arctic climate change.

\subsection{Previous work}

\label{sec:previousworks}
%
Ground-based measurements inside the Artic region are very sparse and can not
be used for monotoring, but are still of interest for validation purpose.
Hence, we must rely on satellite data. As the area experiences polar night and
has extensive cloud cover, optical and infrared techniques suffer basic
limititations that microwave radiometry lacks and the later is the set of
satellite sensors of concern here. Over the polar regions, a challenge
encountered by passive microwave observations is the high and highly variable
contribution by surface emission.

The most important work towards retreival of WVP from microwave humidity
sounders (such as Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) and Microwave
Humidity Sounder (MHS)) comes from University of Bremen. Their retrieval
concept was initiated by \citet{miao:2001:atmos}, where they utilized water
vapour absorption channels around 183\,GHz and 150\,GHz window channel to
retrieve total water vapour (TWV) upto 7\,kg m$^{-2}$. Subsequently in the
study \citep{} they extended this approach to include 89\,GHz to retrieve TWV
upto 15\,kg m$^{-2}$ over sea-ice regions and formulated a relationship between
sea-ice emissivity over different frequencies using measurement campaigns.
Later, \cite{scarlat:2018:retri} extended the method to include all surface
types using AMSU-B. A comparison of the retrieved WVP against ERA-Interim
showed that the over winter months, the RMSD was 1.86\,kg m$^{-2}$ but over
summer months the errors were up to 5.67 m$^{-2}$ due to the algorithm being
constrained by its upper retrieval limit of 15 m$^{-2}$. Besides MW sounding,
an attempt at TWV has also been made using low frequency microwave observations
from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR). For example,
\citet{scarlat:2017:exper} use optimal estimation (OEM) for multi-parameter
retrieval over Arctic, and \citet{zabolotskikh:2020:anadv} attempt at TWV
retrieval over both open ocean and sea-ice regions using neural networks based
inversion. In both products, the highest uncertainties in the retrieval are
linked to the empirical estimates of surface emissivity over sea-ice regions.


The lack of an accurate atmospheric data over the extensive Arctic sea-ice regions has implications in the forecast skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Though the  models are themselves suffer from limitations associated with the modelling of snow, sea ice, mixed-phase clouds, \citet{lawrence:2019:usean} show that MW sounding observations have a clear positive impact on the predictive skill in the summer months. Over the winter months the optimal utilisation of the observations is constrained by the presence of snow and sea-ice. Infact,  increasing the usage of satellite data over all surfaces in Integrated Forecast System (IFS) is identified as one of the priorities in ECMWF Strategy for 2021-2030. 


\subsection{The way forward}

\subsubsection{Problems and solutions}

Remote sensing provides indirect measurements and the data retrieval always
offers some degree of complexity. When using passive satellite microwave data
to estimate humidities over the Arctic region, as mentioned, the main
limiting factor is the surface's contribution to measured radiances. The
special role of the surface is due to high atmospheric transmissivities and the
difficulties to predict the surface properties of snow (on either land or ice).
The main solution today is to reject channels with a significant surface
contribution. This gives a low utilisation rate of the satellite data, and
leaves the humidity close to the surface unconstrained.

For this reason, efforts are being made to improve the "forward modelling",
i.e.\ use auxiliary data to predict the local radiative properties of snow. This
constitutes a very hard problem as the properties depend on a high number of
snow variables. There will be progress in the area, but it will likely be slow.
There is also another, less discussed, consideration, that the satellite
footprint can cover both sea ice and open water. To handle this, a large scale
ice-fraction is not sufficient, even the distribution of ice and water inside
the footprint matters. That is, retrievals above leads are particularly
problematic. The risk of having an inhomogeneuos footprint increases with
footprint size, and good spatial resolution is thus advantageous even if the
atmospheric fields show little horizontal variability.

We will attack these issues from a new angle, now feasible due to progress in
machine learning (ML). We avoid the limitations in traditional approaches by
basing the inversions on a retrieval database, that is used to train the ML
model. The simulated observations in the database are generated on
high-resolution data and variations of both surface and atmospheric variables
inside the footprint get included. In addition, by simulating "scenes" of
adjacent footprints, and not just individual ones, the information hidden in
the overlap of footprints can be exploited. The later effectively increases the
horizontal resolution, but also provides background spatial information, such
as indications on if the surface is homogeneous or mixed.


\subsubsection{Some clarifications}

The ML approach to be applied is introduced by us and operates in a Bayesian
manner. Most importantly, it provides robust case specific error estimates.
That is, an uncertainty is assigned to each individual retrieval.

The database works like the prior assumptions in a standard Bayesian retrieval,
but by using ML we are not restricted to Gaussian statistics, can handle
strongly non-linear problems, and we can include aspects that are very
difficult to handle in traditional retrievals (such as inhomogeneuos
footprints). It is not needed to predict the conditions exactly where the
observation is made, it suffices that simulations have a similar variability as
reality. The ML algorithm uses the database provided to give the posterior
knowledge of the quantity sought, given the scene of observations.

If useful additional information can be provided, this can be incorporated in
the ML training. For example, if there is progress in snow modelling and the
local emissivity can be estimated with some certainty, this can be seen as a
virtual measurement and be used to improve the ML model.



\section{Project description}
%
This project aims at providing standalone physically based water retrievals over the Arctic, which can be comparable to or better in performance than ERA5 reanalyses. A recent study by \citet{graham:2019:evalu} compared the reanalyses against ground observations and showed that ERA5 reanalyses have high skill in estimating total column water vapour but fail at relative humidity estimates. The general moisture profiles from reanalyses work well only when thick cloud layers extend close to the surface. However, for most cases the representation of cloudiness is underestimated or at wrong altitudes. 

In this study, the overall idea would be to combine sophisticated 3D radiative transfer with machine learning to handle the solve the Artic water retrieval and the associated uncertainties using only microwave observations. 

The ambition would be to include temperature sounding channels and solve issues related to low level cloudiness.  \todo


The scheme of the overall project is described in Figure~\ref{fig:flowchart}.

\begin{figure*}[t]

	\includegraphics[trim=140 290 20 100,clip,height = 90mm]{flowchart.pdf} 
	\caption{Flowchart displaying schema of the proposed retrieval system.}
	\label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure*}


%We would employ high resolution SAR imagery and model reanalyses to perform radiative transfer simulations with ARTS. The pure forward model simulations for selected frequencies would then serve as input. We will utilize  Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN), a machine learning technique to invert the simulated brightness temperatures (TB) to WVP. The database with simulated TB profiles is generated using Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS). 

\subsection{Data and tools}
%
 
\subsubsection{Satellite instruments}

The scheme developed here would not only be applicable to existing conical radiometers like  Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) and cross-track radiometers e.g.\, Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS); but also the upcoming satellite instruments like Arctic Weather Satellite (AWS) and MicroWave Imager (MWI). MWI would be part of the next generation of European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Polar System - Second Generation. AWS is envisaged as part of the constellation of small polar-orbiting satellites providing measurements at a high temporal resolution. AWS originates in an initiative by SNSA, and Sweden (through SNSA) is also the largest contributor to the funding of the mission. A brief description of the relevant instruments is provided in Table~\ref{tab:specifications_instruments}. 

As a first step, the methodology would be applied to high frequency channels of SSMIS. Inclusion of lower frequencies and further extension to cross-track microwave radiometers (e.g. ATMS) would be the next step. This can also be termed as preparatory step towards operational use of AWS.

\subsubsection{HARMONIE-AROME}
%
\label{sec:harmonie}
HARMONIE-AROME numerical weather prediction system is the first regional reanalysis focussing on the Arctic regions \citep{bengtsson:2017:harmo}. The reanalyses covers the period from 1997 to 2021 and are available at 2.5\,km horizontal resolution, thus providing more local detailing than ERA5 global reanalysis products.  
 
\subsubsection{QRNN}
%
\label{sec:qrnn}
The neural network (NN) training is a process of learning to predict the outputs {$y_i$} from inputs {$x_i$} through a series of learnable transformations. In traditional NN techniques, the output is a point estimate of the target variable. However, QRNN is trained to minimise the mean of the quantile loss function and predict chosen quantiles of its Bayesian a posterior distribution. QRNN can be seen as a machine learning version of Bayesian Monte Carlo integration (BMCI) to solve ill-posed problems. A detailed description of QRNN can be found in \citet{pfreundschuh:aneur:18}.  

In all the applications QRNN has been tested so far, it has outperformed the existing approaches. This includes a very recent study by the main applicant for predicting clear noise-free clear-sky radiances from microwave humidity channels \citep{kaur:2021:canma}. Previously, \citet{pfreundschuh:aneur:18} had shown the advanatge of QRNN in predicting cloud top pressure from observations by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Recent studies with QRNN also include working with GPROF team  to replace BMCI by QRNN for GPROF retrievals (manuscript in preparation).


\subsubsection{ARTS}
\label{sec:arts}
% 
The backbone of our work is buliding the database with simulated TB using ARTS (Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator, \url{www.radiativetransfer.org}). ARTS has some unique features, but in this context it is rather the completeness and flexibility of ARTS that is
helpful. There is now a second cornerstone of the ARTS infrastructure, the
associated database of single scattering properties \citep{eriksson:agene:18}.
The main part contains data for 36 particle ``habits'' assuming totally random
orientation (TRO). Already this makes the database the most comprehensive one.
Some data for azimuthally random orientation (ARO) are also at hand
\citep{brath:micro:20,ekelund:micro:20}. In principle more ARO data of ice
hydrometeors are needed, but in \citet{baralakas:intro:21} we show that the ARO
case can be fairly well approximated by scaling TRO data. In an ongoing master
thesis project data for melting particles are being generated, and this then
fills the main remaining gap in the database.

\subsection{Preliminary results}
%
This project will build up on the ongoing efforts, hence we shall briefly summarize the preparatory steps we have undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of the project using high frequency measurements from conical scanners.

\subsubsection{Radiative transfer simulations}
%
Towards creating as realistic and comprehensive retrieval databases as possible, we prepare for the complex radiative transfer calculations using the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) frequencies and polarisations. GMI provides observations upto 65$^{\circ}$ and is used as a baseline to formulate the full range of atmospheric and oceanic conditions, including snow and sea-ice emissivities over higher latitudes. The GMI measurements for frequencies around 166\,GHz and 183\,GHz are simulated using Cloudsat radar measurements. A dbZ based systems as described by \citet{ekelund:using:20} is followed and onion peeling retrieval method is used to invert CloudSat reflectivities to Ice Water Content (IWC). The emissivity over land and water are taken from Tool to Estimate Land-Surface Emissivities at Microwave frequencies \citep{aires} and Tool to Estimate Sea-Surface Emissivity from Microwaves to sub-Millimetre waves \citep{prigent}. However for snow and sea-ice surface types an empirical snow and ice emissivity model based on experimental and modelling studies is used. The details are described in Sec~\ref{sec:emissivity}.

\end{figure*}

In order to verify that the data in the training database covers the actual measurement space, the measured and simulated TB from GMI are compared statistically. Figure~\ref{fig:histogram_2d} shows the polarisation difference (PD) and TB histograms from 166 GHz for different surface types. The PD is defined as difference between V and H polarisations. The effect of including particle orientation using the scheme of \citep{baralakas:intro:21} indeed looks promising to mimic the effect of hydrometeor interaction.
Over both sea-ice and snow, the PDs are mostly positive as a consequence of hydrometeor scattering, and the negative PDs arise from noise in clear-sky measurements. For all surface types, the variability of our simulations is higher than the GMI measurements, indicating that the simulations can cover the all possible range of conditions. This is important as we cannot expect the retrieval to provide a complete picture, if the training database covers the measurement range partially.

The basic idea is to produce simulated passive observations that are consistent with
the basic information provided by the radar

\subsubsection{Retrievals}

\begin{figure*}[t]

	\label{fig:WVP_retrievals}
\end{figure*}


The QRNN algorithm described in sec~\ref{sec:qrnn} is applied to measured TB from GMI frequencies: 166 V\,GHz, 166 H\,GHz, 183$\pm$3\,GHz and 183$\pm$7\,GHz, to retrieve the corresponding WVPs. Two-metre temperature, latitude and surface type are also provided as auxiliary information. No data filtering is applied. In order to compare the retrieved WVP with ERA5 total column water  vapour (TCWV), the retrievals are re-gridded to 2.5$^{\circ}$ resolution. A comparison of the near global maps (between 45$^\circ$ - 65$^\circ$) of monthly means from both datasets is displayed in fig~\ref{fig:WVP_retrievals}. The two spatial distributions largely agree with each other except for few high WVP values in the southern hemisphere. The correlation between the two datasets is 0.97. Over southern hemisphere, the saturation of high frequency channels over high humidity regions could be responsible for the inaccurate retrievals. 

\subsection{Work Flow}


%The main task of project the first part is to create as realistic and comprehensive retrieval databases as possible. These calculations would at least include a description of the footprint response and a variety of particle models. The ambition of the project is to add more details which can reproduce the both high and highly variable emissivities over the sea-ice and snow regions.  It would also be important to include details of the particle orientation and impact of footprint remapping. The overall retrieval setup will be similar to as employed in studies like \citep{eriksson:towar:20, ekelund:using:20}. The main output of the retrievals would be WVP, but indirect results like high resolution retrieval of liquid water content, snowfall and sea-ice concentration and would also be an added advantage. 


\subsubsection{Work packages}

\subsubsection*{WP 1: Basic atmospheric scenarios}
%
\label{sec:emissivity}
As pointed out in \citet{eriksson:towar:20}, the input to the simulations can
be obtained from atmospheric models providing a sufficiently detailed
description of hydrometeors \citep[e.g.][]{wang2017statistical}. This approach
relies on the model to mimic the clouds and precipitation with sufficient accuracy. The second approach is to base the simulations directly on observations as far as possible \citep{ekelund:using:20}. In this study, we shall use the former approach and use reanalyses from HARMONIE-AROME to create a database of the atmospheric cases. HARMONIE-AROME doesnt cover all Arctic regions, so if needed, reanalyses from ERA5 could also be included, if needed. This mode shall be independent of the microphysical assumptions of the forward model, but would instead rely on the microphysics defined in the model. If found necessary, we could explore the latter approach and apply our own microphysical assumptions.

Furthermore, the high resolution SAR imagery would be employed to characterize the sea-ice/open waters. The fine spatial resolution of SAR would facilitate better mapping of inhomogeneous surface types, and thus reduce errors with modelling ocean-atmosphere heat flux in mixed surface types such as coastlines and polynyas. To our best knowledge, this would be the first instance where such high resolution information would be used. The high resolution atmospheric and surface inputs would contribute to preserving the spatial information contained in overlap between the channel footprints. 

The output of this work package would be a broad set of 3D atmospheric scenarios to be used as input to the radiative transfer simulations.

\subsubsection*{WP 2 : Emissivity model}
%
\label{sec:emissivity}
An important step to accomplish this project task is the estimation of the surface emissivity spectra over a multitude of surface types. Presently we use an empirical snow and sea-ice emissivity model valid for conical scanners. Assuming specular reflection, we used existing modelling and experimental studies\citep{harlow:2009:milli, harlow:2012:tundr,hewison:2002:airbo} to define the valid ranges of emissivity variability for 166\,GHz and 183\,GHz frequencies.  Differences between H and V polarisation are also taken into account. 

\begin{equation}
...
\end{equation}

As a first step, we would use existing studies to extend this model to lower frequencies such as 89\,GHz and temperature sounding channels around 50\,GHz. Such an empirical model would be easy to fine-tuned by comparing results from pure forward modelling and actual measurements. However, the final aim would be to use Optimal Estimation method (OEM) to extract microwave emissivity spectra from TB, particularly for sea-ice surface types. We would consider joint retrievals of emissivity spectra over all frequencies. Synergy between such retrievals is especially useful to exploit the emissivity correlations between frequencies, and make it more viable from assimilation perspective. 

	
\subsubsection*{WP 3 : Database creation and post-processing}
%
\label{sec:database}	
This WP would cover the initiation and execution of the batch radiative transfer calculations (by ARTS). Initially some time will be needed to implement the scripts needed for the basic calculations, to add jobs to the calculation cluster and the post-processing needed. As a start, only conical scanners would be simulated, and later extension to cross-track scanners should be straighforward. For the latter, a number of scan angles, between nadir and swath edge, will be covered.

For both type of scanners, the overlapping antenna footprint of all frequencies will be explicitly simulated so that it is feasible to retrieve parameters at a finer scale than individual antenna beams. To generate the antenna pattern at a the desired frequency, a number of pencil beam radiative transfer calculations will be performed to incorporate both along-track and across-track sampling. Bias adjustments to the forward model simulations would also be made  as a post-processing step. For forward modelling to accurately represent the satellite measurements, bias adjustments as calculated by ECMWF would be applied to all simulations. Sensor calibration and its relative agreement with the forward model are vital for the success of the retrieval database. 
The WP output shall be batches of simulated radiances.

\subsubsection*{WP 4 : Retrieval setup}
%
The package for QRNN is already available as a part the Typhon software package \citep{lemke:2020:typhon}. The implementation of the retrieval algorithm shall be relatively straightforward but the challenge would be to find the best performing neural-network architecture so as to achieve the best model performance. Besides, it would also be important to test the sensitivity of various auxiliary data to the retrieval performance. In order to run the retrievals, we shall make use of the Chalmers central computational cluster (C3SE).

\subsubsection*{WP 5 : Retrievals}
%
The use of the retrieval database shall we made without introducing any re-mapping between the different footprint sizes. All footprints inside a region would be used as input, and the database generation will mimic this. This approach will make much better use of
the spatial information provided by the overlap of instrument footprints. This has been demonstrated using 2DVAR in \citep{duncan:onthe:19}. But here we shall aim to achieve the same purpose by using QRNN. In fact, by doing this by a database (and not 2DVAR) we are not restricted to describe spatial correlations by covariance matrices and the QRNN version should be even more advantageous.

In the development phase, combinations of various frequency channels would be tried to attain the best possible performance.

\subsubsection*{WP 6: Evaluation and dissemination}

The main tasks of this work package are to understand the quality of the retrievals, and pave way for their optimal use. The existing WVP retrievals from polar orbiting satellites do offer well sampled datasets, but the skill of the datasets is highly variable over different atmospheric and surface conditions. For example, in central Arctic, the differences between monthly means over summer months can be as high as 30\% \citep{crewell:2021:asyst}. Since in this project we aim to solve the retrieval issues associated with the ever complex and changing surface characteristics of sea-ice, a detailed assessment would be expected to improve the applicability and future retrieval algorithms. In this work package a thorough investigation with the available \textit{in-situ} data, satellite products and reanalysis would be made. Firstly, direct comparisons with radio-soundings or data from flight campaigns would be used to estimate the accuracy of the product and reveal the uncertainties on finer scales.  Statistical comparisons with other microwave and IR based humidity products  will also be made. Time series of daily and monthly means, and the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the retrievals would be analysed. Here it would also be important to analyse the accuracy over seasons and different surface types.

\subsubsection*{WP 7 : Additional Retrievals}

\todo{LWC}

\todo{snow}

The MW emissivity spectra has characteristic features important to retrieve the sea-ice concentration. The high resolution emissivity retrievals can additionally be post-processed to generate estimates of SIC. The post-processing simply involves matching the 1D-VAR emissivity estimates over sea-ice to a pre-computed catalog of mean emissivity spectra. Infact, validation of the SIC against other available products like MiRS (Microwave Integrated Retrieval System) based operational cyrogenic products (\url{https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/mirs/highresolutionv.php}) can also serve as an indirect validation of the emissivity retrievals.

In order to receive feedback on the retrieval database, we would closely collaborate with group working on WVP retrievals at University of Bremen to cover the analysis and validation aspects. Additionally, a contact with the group of Prof. Susanne Crewell would be also be useful for validation purposes. Their group is operating the MiRaC airborne sensor (a combined radar and radiometer) during polar flights (Mech et al., 2019).
